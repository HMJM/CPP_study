		Style Sheets (CSS)</a> is a <strong><u>style</u> sheet language</strong> used for describing the
	presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of
	the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. </p>

<p> CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and
	fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the
	specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
	specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the
	structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between
	the pages that share the file and its formatting. </p>
