		target="_blank" title="JS specification">JavaScript</a> often abbreviated as JS, is a programming
	language that conforms to <strong>the <u>ECMAScript</u> specification</strong>. JavaScript is
	high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic
	typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. </p>

<p>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript
	enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of
	websites use it for client-side page behavior, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript
	engine to execute it. </p>
